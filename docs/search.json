    "text": "Join us for the first SPHERE-PPL Annual Meeting, focussing on Health Modelling & Forecasting!\nThis full-day event will bring together experts in a range of fields from industry, academia, and government to discuss cutting-edge research and explore collaborative opportunities within health.\nMeeting participants will:\n\nNetwork with policy specialists and data scientists to discuss issues through a common language\nIdentify forecasting challenges to be undertaken by the SPHERE-PPL Community, and shape their design & outputs to maximise impact\nPrioritise the training and support that SPHERE-PPL provide to the community to fast-track analytical capability into where it is needed most\n\nThis event and the subsequent forecasting contests have been generously funded by The Alan Turing Institute. For more information, please email info@sphere-ppl.org.\n\n\n\n\nComplete this form by Friday 29th November 2024.\nAttendance is free but participation is limited to 50 in-person attendees, with an application required (there is no limit on the number of subsequent forecasting contest participants). We will email successful applicants in early December. Attendance is not limited by sector, discipline, background, or career stage. If you use data to ask questions about health, disease, or healthcare operations, this meeting is for you!\nAfter this event, we will organise a series of follow-up on-line events to kick-off the forecasting contests and provide training in forecasting. More details will be shared at the meeting and afterwards on-line: if you can’t make the meeting, join the mailing list to join in!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTimings\nActivity\nDescription\n\n\n\n\n8:30-9:00\nArrivals & Registration\n\n\n\n9:00-9:10\nWelcome & Housekeeping\n\n\n\n9:10-9:30\nIntroduction from the SPHERE-PPL Team\nMeet the team and an introduction to the vision\n\n\n9:30-10:00\nKeynote 1 - Dr Lauren Cator\ntbc\n\n\n10:00-10:30\nKeynote 2 - Dr Will Pearse\nHow forecasting and probabilistic programming can improve health outcomes\n\n\n10:30-11:00\nCoffee Break\n\n\n\n11:00-12:00\nBreak-Out Discussion\nIdentifying key challenges in health policy\n\n\n12:00-12:30\nBreak-Out Feedback\n2-minute presentations on challenges\n\n\n12:30-13:30\nLunch\n\n\n\n13:30-14:15\nBreak-Out Design\nGroups design forecasting contests\n\n\n14:15-15:00\nBreak-Out Feedback\nGroup feedback and discussion of contest priorities\n\n\n15:00-15:30\nCoffee Break\n\n\n\n15:30-15:40\nPresentation - Dr Josh Tyler\nWhat can SPHERE-PPL do for you?\n\n\n15:40-16:10\nBreak-Out Discussion\nBrainstorming requests for workshops, training and support\n\n\n16:10-16:30\nBreak-Out Feedback\nCreating a community priority list\n\n\n16:30-17:00\nWrap-Up\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDr Josh Tyler (The Alan Turing Institute)\nDr Will Pearse (Imperial College London)\nDr Ettie Unwin (University of Bristol)\nDr Seth Flaxman (University of Oxford)\nRuth Drysdale (The Alan Turing Institute)\n\n\n\n\n\nFull Address: The Alan Turing Institute, British Library, 96 Euston Rd, London NW1 2DB\nSee the Turing Website for details of transport to the Institute: How to get to the Turing"
